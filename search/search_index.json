You can find examples of such systems and resources in a social network to share work experience or personal events or a computer network to share file storage, printer access, or internet connectivity. A network connects computers, mobile phones, peripherals, and even IoT (Internet of Things) devices. Switches, routers, and wireless access points (APs) are the essential networking basics. Through them, devices connected to your network can communicate with one another and with other networks, such as the internet, which is a global system of interconnected computer networks. A network of computers and other components that are located relatively close together in a limited area is often referred to as a LAN . Every LAN has specific components, including hardware, interconnections, and software. WAN communication occurs between geographically separated areas. It is typically provided by different telecommunication providers using various technologies using different media such as fiber, copper, cable, Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL) , or wireless links. In enterprise internetworks, WANs connect the main office, branches, Small Office Home Office (SOHO) , and mobile users. Here are some crucial skills that will be covered in the networking functions section: Explain the functions, characteristics, and common components of a network. Read a network diagram, including comparing and contrasting the logical and physical topologies. Describe the impact of user applications on the network.","title":"Index"},{"location":"Network-Fundamentals/#network-fundamentals-introduction","text":"At the most basic level, a \u201cnetwork\u201d is defined as a group of systems interconnected to share resources.

LAN devices include routers, switches, and end-user devices that connect to routers and switches. A wide area network (WAN) connection is needed to bridge remote offices to the headquarters office, with different types of WAN connections available such as fiber and asynchronous DSL. The enterprise campus has different tiers, including the access layer where end-users connect, the core layer with routers, switches, and data centers, and intermediate devices such as layer-2 and layer-3 switches, routers, and security items. Mobile users are often remote workers who connect to the enterprise campus via the internet. End-user devices include IP-enabled phones, virtual servers, and laptops, while intermediate devices include wireless LAN controllers, security items, and others. Different types of media are used to connect devices to the network, including wireless, serial links for WAN, and Ethernet links for LAN. The OSI model will be discussed to distinguish between different technologies and traffic types. Layer-2 switches make forwarding decisions based on MAC addresses, while layer-3 switches and routers make decisions based on IP addresses. Icons for devices include layer-2 and layer-3 switches, routers, wireless connectivity, and others. I am thinking about using ASCII Flow for icon representation.
