You can find examples of such systems and resources in a social network to share work experience or personal events or a computer network to share file storage, printer access, or internet connectivity. A network connects computers, mobile phones, peripherals, and even IoT (Internet of Things) devices. Switches, routers, and wireless access points (APs) are the essential networking basics. Through them, devices connected to your network can communicate with one another and with other networks, such as the internet, which is a global system of interconnected computer networks. A network of computers and other components that are located relatively close together in a limited area is often referred to as a LAN . Every LAN has specific components, including hardware, interconnections, and software. WAN communication occurs between geographically separated areas. It is typically provided by different telecommunication providers using various technologies using different media such as fiber, copper, cable, Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL) , or wireless links. In enterprise internetworks, WANs connect the main office, branches, Small Office Home Office (SOHO) , and mobile users. Here are some crucial skills that will be covered in the networking functions section: Explain the functions, characteristics, and common components of a network.

A computer network can exist on its own, independent of other computer networks, and it can also connect to other networks. Globally speaking, the internet is an example of many interconnected networks. Eons ago, the internet only connected several mainframe computers with computer terminals. The mainframe computers were large, and their computing power was considered enormous, although their computing power is equivalent to today's smartphones. The internet now connects not only laptops, smartphones, and tablets, but also IoT (Internet of Things) devices, TVs, game consoles, and much more. The earlier concept of centralized computing is revived today in the cloud. Users who wish to connect their networks to the internet can acquire access through a service provider's access network. The service provider can use different technologies from dialup or broadband telephony networks , such as ADSL networks , cable networks, mobile, radio or fiber-optic networks. Service provider networks cover large geographical areas and connect with other providers for global coverage. Computer networks can be classified in several ways, and then combined to find the most appropriate one for the implementation. Distance distinguishes local and remote networks between the user and the computer networks the user is accessing. Purpose Examples of networks categorized by their purpose would be data center networks and SAN . Focusing on the technology used, you can distinguish between wireless or wired networks. Size Looking at the size of the network in terms of the number of devices it has, there are various types of networks. Such as small networks, usually with fewer than ten devices, medium to large networks consisting of tens to hundreds of devices, and very large, global networks, such as the internet, which connects thousands of devices across the world. Geographical Scope LAN Local area networks connect devices located relatively close together in a limited area. An example would be a university campus network that can span several collocated buildings. Intranet An intranet is a private computer network that uses Internet technologies to securely share any part of an organization's information or operational systems within that organization. So, if the LAN is limited to internal use within an organization and is not accessible to the public, it can be referred to as an intranet. However, all intranets are LANs, but not all LANs are intranets. WAN Wide area networks cover a broad geographical area and are managed by service providers. MAN A computer network that interconnects users with computer resources in a geographic region of the size of a metropolitan area, such as a city. Image of the Cisco Enterprise Architecture Model In the realm of medium-to-large enterprise networks, it's common for them to span across multiple locations, such as a main office or Enterprise Campus that houses most of the corporate resources, and remote sites like branch offices or home offices of remote workers. The latter is typically referred to as a small office, home office (SOHO), which generally only has a few devices and primarily connects to the main office network via the internet. The main office network is usually a Local Area Network (LAN) that may consist of multiple networks occupying multiple floors or a campus with several buildings. Wireless networks are often required on a large scale in corporate environments and are managed through Wireless LAN Controllers (WLC). Additionally, most Enterprise Campuses have a separate data center that houses the computational power, storage, and applications necessary to support business operations. A firewall is typically used to protect internet connectivity, and branch offices have their own LANs and resources such as printers and servers, but depend on the main office for operations and connect via a WAN or internet using routers. Due to their importance in supporting business activities, enterprise networks must be secure, resilient, and allow for growth. The design of a network requires extensive technical knowledge, and network engineers often utilize validated network architecture models such as the Cisco three-tier hierarchical network architecture model, the spine-leaf model, and the Cisco Enterprise Architecture model to assist in their design and implementation. These models provide hierarchical structure to enterprise networks in the form of layers, such as LAN Access and LAN Core, which provide different functionalities. Protocols # Protocols are a detailed set of rules that govern successful network communication. The rules define various situations, methods, and behaviors that every communicating device should follow. The examples of specifications that protocols include are the voltage to use for an electrical signal, which messages are allowed in communication, what are the building blocks of the messages, what is to be done if a message is lost, and what should be done if the message contains an error. The exchange of data within the internet follows the same well-defined protocol rules, designed specifically for internet communication. Protocols define how data is transmitted between devices in networks and how it allows the devices to communicate with each other. The analogy to communication between two devices would be two people talking the same language. Protocols are typically created according to the industry standard by various networking or information technology organizations. The internet is a base for various data exchange services, such as email or file transfers. It is a common global infrastructure, composed of many computer networks connected that follow communication rules standardized for the internet. A set of documents called RFCs defines the protocols and processes of the internet. Request for Comments (RFC) is a document that is written by the technical and standards-setting bodies for the internet. In the following examples, you will browse through some of the RFCs that you can find at https://www.ietf.org/standards/rfcs/. Note # The words internet and web are often used interchangeably, but they do not share the same meaning. The internet is a global network that interconnects many networks and therefore provides a worldwide communication infrastructure. The World Wide Web describes one way to provide and access information over the internet using a web browser. It is a service that relies on connections provided by the internet for its function.
