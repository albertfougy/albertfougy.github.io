Mobile users are often remote workers who connect to the enterprise campus via the internet. The enterprise campus has different tiers, including the access layer where end-users connect, the core layer with routers, switches, and data centers, and intermediate devices such as layer-2 and layer-3 switches, routers, and security items. End-user devices include IP-enabled phones, virtual servers, and laptops, while intermediate devices include wireless LAN controllers, security items, and others. Different types of media are used to connect devices to the network, including wireless, serial links for WAN, and Ethernet links for LAN.
