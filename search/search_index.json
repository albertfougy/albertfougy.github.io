You can find examples of such systems and resources in a social network to share work experience or personal events or a computer network to share file storage, printer access, or internet connectivity. A network connects computers, mobile phones, peripherals, and even IoT (Internet of Things) devices. Switches, routers, and wireless access points (APs) are the essential networking basics. Through them, devices connected to your network can communicate with one another and with other networks, such as the internet, which is a global system of interconnected computer networks. A network of computers and other components that are located relatively close together in a limited area is often referred to as a LAN . Every LAN has specific components, including hardware, interconnections, and software. WAN communication occurs between geographically separated areas. It is typically provided by different telecommunication providers using various technologies using different media such as fiber, copper, cable, Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL) , or wireless links. In enterprise internetworks, WANs connect the main office, branches, Small Office Home Office (SOHO) , and mobile users. Here are a few skills that will be covered in the networking fundamental section: Explain the functions, characteristics, and common components of a network. Read a network diagram, including comparing and contrasting the logical and physical topologies . Describe the impact of user applications on the network.","title":"Index"},{"location":"Network-Fundamentals/#network-fundamentals-introduction","text":"At the most basic level, a \u201cnetwork\u201d is defined as a group of systems interconnected to share resources.

Globally speaking, the internet is an example of many interconnected networks. A computer network connects devices that allows them to exchange data with each other, which facilitates information and resource sharing. - Cisco University. Eons ago, the internet only connected several mainframe computers with computer terminals. The mainframe computers were large, and their computing power was considered enormous, although their computing power is equivalent to today's smartphones. The internet now connects not only laptops, smartphones, and tablets, but also IoT (Internet of Things) devices, TVs, game consoles, and much more. The earlier concept of centralized computing is revived today in the cloud. Users who wish to connect their networks to the internet can acquire access through a service provider's access network. The service provider can use different technologies from dialup or broadband telephony networks , such as ADSL networks , cable networks, mobile, radio or fiber-optic networks. Service provider networks cover large geographical areas and connect with other providers for global coverage. Computer networks can be classified in several ways, and then combined to find the most appropriate one for the implementation. Distance Between the user and the computer network the user is accessing, there is a distance that distinguishes the local and remote networks. Purpose Examples of networks categorized by their purpose would be data center networks and SAN . Focusing on the technology used, you can distinguish between wireless or wired networks. Size Looking at the size of the network in terms of the number of devices it has, there are various types of networks. Such as small networks, usually with fewer than ten devices, medium to large networks consisting of tens to hundreds of devices, and very large, global networks, such as the internet, which connects thousands of devices across the world. Geographical Scope - LAN Local area networks connect devices located relatively close together in a limited area. An example would be a university campus network that can span several collocated buildings. (Special Mention) Intranet An intranet is a private computer network that uses Internet technologies to securely share any part of an organization's information or operational systems within that organization. So, if the LAN is limited to internal use within an organization and is not accessible to the public, it can be referred to as an intranet. However, all intranets are LANs, but not all LANs are intranets. WAN Wide area networks cover a broad geographical area and are managed by service providers. MAN A computer network that interconnects users with computer resources in a geographic region of the size of a metropolitan area, such as a city. Image of the Cisco Enterprise Architecture Model Protocols # Why do we need network protocols/standards? Network protocols are a set of rules that define how devices communicate with each other in a network. These protocols include specifications such as signal voltage, allowable messages, message structure, lost message management, and error handling. They establish a common set of guidelines for all devices in a network, ensuring that information can be transmitted and received reliably and efficiently. The need for network protocols arises from the fact that devices need an agreed-upon system of communicating, much like two people speaking the same language. Ethernet, for example, is a collection of network protocols and standards that serves as an example of such a system for network devices. Ethernet includes protocols for media access, packet structure, and error handling, which allows devices to communicate with each other in a standardized way. Similarly, the internet follows a well-defined set of protocol rules, specifically designed for internet communication. These protocols dictate how data is transmitted between devices in networks and how devices communicate with each other. Industry-standard protocols are typically created by various networking or information technology organizations. Examples of such organizations include the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). The internet is a global infrastructure composed of many computer networks that follow standardized communication rules. It supports various data exchange services, such as email or file transfers. The protocols and processes of the internet are defined in a set of documents called Request for Comments (RFCs). These documents are maintained by the Internet Engineering Task Force and are freely available to the public. By following standardized protocols and processes, the internet allows devices and networks to communicate with each other in a reliable and efficient manner, making it one of the most important technological innovations of modern times. In the following examples, you will browse through some of the RFCs that you can find at https://www.ietf.org/standards/rfcs/ . Note The words internet and web are often used interchangeably, but they do not share the same meaning. The internet is a global network that interconnects many networks and therefore provides a worldwide communication infrastructure. The World Wide Web describes one way to provide and access information over the internet using a web browser. It is a service that relies on connections provided by the internet for its function.
