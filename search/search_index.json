DESCRIPTION # The description provided by Cisco U offers an overview of the subject matter I will be focusing on. It's worth noting that in the following description, I switch from the second person to the first person. The CCNA learning path offers comprehensive associate-level training focused on the technologies I will need to implement and administer networking and IT infrastructure. Completing this learning path will help me prepare for the Cisco Certified Network Associate (200-301 CCNA) exam and earn my CCNA certification.

If it becomes apparent that there are an excessive number of terms in each section, I will consolidate them into a separate menu.","title":"Index"},{"location":"Cisco-CCNA-Exam-Prep/#cisco-ccna-exam-prep","text":"In preparation for the CCNA exam, I am taking notes from various resources, primarily Cisco University & Jeremy's IT Lab .

You can find examples of such systems and resources in a social network to share work experience or personal events or a computer network to share file storage, printer access, or internet connectivity. A network connects computers, mobile phones, peripherals, and even IoT (Internet of Things) devices. Switches, routers, and wireless access points (APs) are the essential networking basics. Through them, devices connected to your network can communicate with one another and with other networks, such as the internet, which is a global system of interconnected computer networks. A network of computers and other components that are located relatively close together in a limited area is often referred to as a LAN . Every LAN has specific components, including hardware, interconnections, and software. WAN communication occurs between geographically separated areas. It is typically provided by different telecommunication providers using various technologies using different media such as fiber, copper, cable, Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL) , or wireless links. In enterprise internetworks, WANs connect the main office, branches, Small Office Home Office (SOHO) , and mobile users. Here are some crucial skills that will be covered in the networking functions section: Explain the functions, characteristics, and common components of a network. Read a network diagram, including comparing and contrasting the logical and physical topologies. Describe the impact of user applications on the network.","title":"Index"},{"location":"Network-Fundamentals/#network-fundamentals-introduction","text":"At the most basic level, a \u201cnetwork\u201d is defined as a group of systems interconnected to share resources.
